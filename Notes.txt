- try changing some options on PWM (freq) and a different PWM implementation to reduce hum

Reflashing
    On board the labelling for rx and tx are from the programmer point of view i.e. connect Tx to Tx and Rx to Rx
    Need to add to jumper J3
	Serial speed is set to 57600

Remove jumper and reboot
H801 starts an AP 
Connect to it using mobile phone and setup config
You may need to try this a few time
If successfull the red and green leds should both be lit
Seems to take a long time to present the web page and save config - may need to leave it a while
